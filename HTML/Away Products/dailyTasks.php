  <h2>Each Day:</h2>
  <h2>Team must unload a “returns” truck and account for all returned items. Once the returns are verified, the team
    sorts, cleans, re-boxes, re-labels, and grades the items before putting them away. Our goal is to maintain a
    seamless returns process and uphold the highest standards of quality and organization.</h2>

  <h2>We begin by processing any backlog items in the system (items sitting in the warehouse longer than 48hrs).</h2>
  <h2>UPS/FEDEX truck</h2>
  <h2>two or more people will help unload it. Two different products arrive, AWAY and non-away. We make sure to separate
    them during the unloading process to avoid mix ups Once everything is unloaded, all tracking numbers will be
    recorded, obtaining the total number of products that arrived, separating them into three main categories: RS,
    Non-RS, and Retail</h2>
  <h2>Metal Basket</h2>
  <h2>Once all tracking numbers are recorded, they will be placed in a metal basket to then be transported to the
    returns department. Once they arrive, they will be removed from the baskets and placed on a pallet to be wrapped and
    counted.</h2>

  <h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">A label will be placed on both sides where the pallet jack enters, and this
    label will include the date the items arrived at the warehouse, the number of products on the pallet,and a legend
    stating that they are indeed RETURNS. Then the sorting, cleaning, re-boxing, re-labeling, and grading of the
    products begin.</h1>
